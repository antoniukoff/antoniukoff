### Hey! I'm Vlad ðŸ‘‹


### ðŸŽ® How I Got Into Programming

My passion for programming began with my childhood love for video games. This led me to explore the realm of C++ and engine development. Ever since, I have been on a mission to create engaging games and engines through coding, with a particular interest in graphics and tools that drive the game design.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Up To

* Engine Development: Crafting a lightweight, efficient game engine that's about optimization and usability.
* Tool Creation: Developing intuitive tools to make game development accessible and fun for designers everywhere.
* Modularity: I love ECS design and like building clean and reusable code(I'm a perfectionist).
* Learning: I love advancing my skills in rendering techniques, modern C++ standards, game tools, and optimization.

### ðŸŽ‰ Fun Fact
When not coding, I'm gaming, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, playing guitar, or reading dystopian books.
  
### ðŸ’¡ Looking For
Opportunities to innovate in-engine graphics and tool development, and optimization of existing codebases.
