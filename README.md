### Hey! I'm Vlad 👋


### 🕹️ Game Programmer | C++ Aficionado | Engine & Graphics Wizard

From gamer to coder: My passion for programming began with my childhood love for video games. This led me to explore the realm of C++ and engine development. Ever since, I have been on a mission to create engaging games and engines through coding, with a particular interest in graphics and tools that drive the game design.

### 🚀 What I'm Up To

* Engine Development: Crafting a lightweight, efficient game engine that's about optimization and usability.
* Tool Creation: Developing intuitive tools to make game development accessible and fun for designers everywhere.
* Modularity: I love ECS design and like building clean and reusable code(I'm a perfectionist@).
* Learning: I love advancing my skills in rendering techniques, modern C++ standards, game tools, and optimization.

### 🎉 Fun Fact
When not coding, I'm gaming, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, playing guitar, or reading dystopian books.
  
### 💡 Looking For
Opportunities to innovate in engine and graphics development, tool-building, and optimization of existing codebase.
