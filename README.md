# Hi, I'm Volodymyr ðŸ‘‹

I'm a game developer with a focus on game engines, graphics programming, and low-level optimization. My projects range from custom game engines to complete games, and this GitHub showcases my technical skills and work.

### ðŸš€ **Projects I'm Proud Of:**
- **[Unbreaded](https://github.com/MashdorDev/unbreaded)**: A 3D action-puzzle platformer where I implemented an AI system with custom behaviors and optimized gameplay code to reduce bugs and boost performance.
- **[Reflecs](https://github.com/antoniukoff/reflecs)**: A fast ECS library for efficient entity management featuring compile-time reflection, individual field pooling, and more.
- **[Inferno Engine](https://github.com/antoniukoff/InfernoEngine-Demo)**: A game engine designed for performant 2D game development featuring batch rendering, particle system, UI, etc.
- **[EvolvECS](https://github.com/antoniukoff/EvolveECS)**: A 3D engine project that includes a physics engine and advanced rendering, all written from the ground up in C++.

Feel free to explore my repositories! Youâ€™ll find a mix of well-documented projects and personal experiments that help me learn and grow as a developer.

### ðŸŽ“ **A bit about me:**
Iâ€™m finishing my Advanced Diploma in Game Programming at Humber College in Toronto. Iâ€™m open to collaboration and always looking for new challenges whether itâ€™s a project idea or just discussing interesting technical topics.
